This is my personal neovim configurations!

I did not used a neovim distro here, only the lazy.nvim plugin manager, mason
package manager, and some other few plugins. I'm having some few troubles here
and there but this was still pretty fun to make lol.

The configurations are really simple and straightforward, I tried to make it as simple
as possible, some stuff are inspired from my previous old neovim configs.

The .editorconfig and .clang-format are meant to be placed in the home directory if you want,
you can also place the .clang-format to a particular project directory, so that only that
particular project applies the format.
